-> Headings in HTML helps the search engine to understand and index the structure of web page.
->  Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

->> HTML PARAGRAPHS - 
-> The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
-> A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
-> If you put a lot of spaces inside the HTML p tag, browser removes extra spaces and extra line while displaying the page. The browser counts number of spaces and lines as a single one.
