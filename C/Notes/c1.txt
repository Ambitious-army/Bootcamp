                                     Chapter - 1   (Basics Of C Programming) 
C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (INTRODUCTION)

-> C Was Developed By Dennis M. Ritchie To Develop The Unix Operating System at AT&T Bell laboratories.
-> C Was Originally First Implemented In 1972. 

C PROGRAMMING - 
1) Easy To Learn. 
2) Structured Language. 
3) It Produces Effiecent Programs. 
4) It Can Be Compiled On a Variety Of Computer Platforms. 
5) It Can Handle Low Level Activites. 

FACTS ABOUT C - 
1) C was Invented To Write An Operating System Called UNIX. 
2) C is a Successor Of B Language Which Was Introduced Around 1970.
3) The Language Was Formalized In 1988 By The American National Standard Institute (ANSI).


IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - 
-> IDE is A Better Alternative Of Notepad Which Gives Syntax Highlighting + Better Error Handling and More Feature.
Examples - VS CODE , ECSLIPE, SUB - LIME TEXT EDITOR , BRACKETS AND MORE.

->(IMP) -> The Files You Create With Your Editor(IDE) Are Called The Source Files and They Contain The Program 
Source Codes. The Source Files of C Programs Are Typically Named With The Extension".c"

C COMPILER - 
-> The Comiler Compiles The Source Codes Into Final Executable Programs. 
-> Source Code Compiles Into Machine Language So CPU Can Execute The Program As Per The Instruction.

-> C is considered as Middle Level Language Because It Supports The Feature Of Both Low Level And High Level Languages.
-> It Supports Pointer Arthmetic and c is also converted into assembly code so It Has Feature Of Low Level Language.
-> It is Machine independent And Easily Developed By User. Which is The Feature Of High Level Lannguage.

COMPUTER PROGRAMMING - 
-> Steps Of Instruction Given To CPU So Thay Can Execute Program.
