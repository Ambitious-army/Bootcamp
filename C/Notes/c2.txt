C PROGRAMMING (STRUCTURE)
-> They Consist Following Parts - 
1) Preprocessor Commands.
2) Functions. 
3) Variables. 
4) Statement & Expressions.
5) Comments. 

Flow Of C Program - 1.Preprocessing - Preprocessor is Not The Part Of The Compiler. But it's Seperate Part Of Compilation Process And Some Source Code fully Expanded.(Removes Comments)

2.Compilation - The code which is expanded by the preprocessor is passed to the compiler. The compiler converts this code into assembly code. 

3.Assembly - The assembly code is converted into object code by using an assembler.

4.Linking - Linker Combine The Object Code Of Library Files With The Object Code Of Our Program And Convert It Into The .exe Executable File

5.Loading - The loader will then load the executable file for the execution in the memory and the output is on The
console screen.


BASIC SYNTAX - 
-> Tokens In C 
   -> A C Program Has Various Token. 
   -> Token Are Keywords , An Identifier ,  A Constant ,  A String Literal And Symbol.
   Example - 
      -> printf("Hello World\n");
      This Statement Is Made By Various Tokens.  
      Now Same Statment - 
      -> printf
         (
         "Hello World!\n" 
         )
         ;
         The are Divided Into Individual Tokens. 

-> SEMICOLONS - 
     -> The Semicolons Are Statement Terminator. 
     -> Each Individual Statement Must Be Ended With Semicolons.
     -> It Indicates The End Of One Logical Entity. 

-> COMMENTS - 
     -> Comments Are The Text Ignored By Your Compiler. 
     -> You Can Create Notes Between Coding.
     -> How We Can Write Comments - 
         /* This is A Comment in C Programming */

-> IDENTIFIERS - 
    -> C Identifier is a name used to identify a Variable, Functions, or any other user - defined item.
    -> C Does Not Allow Punctuation characters like @ , $.
    -> C is Case Sensitive Programming Language. 
    -> Sujeet and sujeet or Khushbu or khushbu are different Identifiers.

-> KEYWORDS - 
    -> Keywords is reserved word in c 
    -> They Cannot be used as constant , Variable or any other Identifier names. 
    -> List In whaatsaap
